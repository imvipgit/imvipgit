👨‍💻 About Me

My professional life is dedicated to navigating the complexities of Deep Tech, while my personal life is spent exploring the tranquility of the Deep Woods. This duality shapes my approach to work and life, blending rigorous, first-principles thinking with a grounded, holistic perspective.

As a product leader, I focus on bringing cutting-edge technologies like semiconductors, IoT, and Edge AI to market. I partner with organizations to develop clear strategies, make high-stakes decisions, and build products that solve meaningful problems.

Whether I'm defining a go-to-market strategy or planning a mountain expedition, my goal is the same: to find clarity in complexity.

💡 My Areas of Focus

My work combines strategic thinking with hands-on execution. Here are some of the areas I specialize in:

Product Management: Leading the entire product lifecycle for Semiconductors, IoT, and Edge AI solutions.

Go-to-Market Strategy: Crafting and executing plans to launch and scale tech products.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Using data to uncover insights and validate strategic direction.

Complex Problem Solving: Deconstructing ambiguous challenges into actionable steps.
